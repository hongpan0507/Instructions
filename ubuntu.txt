Ubuntu tips:
1. run the programming in the background: Add & to the end of the command
2. change the size of a window: ctrl + windown key + arrow key
3. change "run" to "exctutable": chmod +x .run file (chmod = change permission)
4. htop: windows version of task manager
5.  jobs - list the current jobs
    fg - resume the job that's next in the queue
    fg %[number] - resume job [number]
    bg - Push the next job in the queue into the background
    bg %[number] - Push the job [number] into the background
    kill %[number] - Kill the job numbered [number]
    kill -[signal] %[number] - Send the signal [signal] to job number [number]
    disown %[number] - disown the process(no more terminal will be owner), so command will be 	  alive even after closing the terminal.
6. use "gnome-open" + "the name of the document" to open up files
