As an alternative (may not be secure or even good idea though) you can always upload the sqlite3 binary to /system/bin this worked for me:

First lets mount /system/ to allow read/write (rw)

$ adb shell
$ su
# mount -o remount,rw /system

in another terminal change directory (cd) to where sqlite3 is and lets push it

$ ls
sqlite3
$ adb push sqlite3 /sdcard/

Now back to the other shell lets copy and change permissions of the binary

# cat /sdcard/sqlite3 > /system/bin/sqlite3
# chmod 4755 /system/bin/sqlite3

Now lets mount back /system/ as read only (ro)

# mount -o remount,ro /system

And now we can use sqlite3 from shell:

# sqlite3 /data/data/com.telly/databases/fun.db
SQLite version 3.7.4
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite> .tables
android_metadata  lulz               

Note: I'm using the sqlite3 binary that comes with "SuperOneClickv1.6.5-ShortFuse"

You can always pull sqlite3 binary from emulator:

Start an emulator and then from a terminal

$ adb pull /system/xbin/sqlite3

If you are lazy like me you can download one right here for ICS or before or for Jelly Bean and later here

Make sure to use the proper one for your Android version as you may get eloc_library[1306]: 14446 cannot locate 'sqlite3_enable_load_extension'... or similar errors on execute
