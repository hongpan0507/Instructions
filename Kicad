# Add multiple copper fill zone
  1. create 1st zone outline
  2. set the priority to the lowest (= 0)
  3. zone priority determines which zone is to be filled up first 
  4. higher priority number gives higher priority
  5. priority must be different when create for the first time between different zones
  
# Keep-out zone for Solder Mask Layer
  Option A: Use Solder Mask Layer as Keep-out layer in Footprinter Editor
    1. In Footprint Editor, select Solder Mask Layer
    2. Make the desired pattern
    3. The pattern is the keep-out zone.
  Option B: Use fill zone as keep-out zone in Pcbnew (PCB routing)
    1. Select Solder Mask Layer
    2. Select "Add filled zone"
    3. Click on the starting point of the keep-out zone
    4. Fill out "Non Copper Zones Properties"
    5. This method works for all non-copper layer
# Add footprint library 
  1. In PCB layout or footprint editor: Preferences->library tables->append with wizard->KiCad
    ->Use path relative to the project->Add FP Libraries->select all the folders (.pretty) that contatins the footprint
  2. Instruction to set environmental path and more: https://lists.launchpad.net/kicad-developers/msg12945.html
