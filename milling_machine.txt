Steps:
1. Place the board in the middle; tape down the board; 
   Drill the holes if necessary; Mounting hole = 125mil; Hole spacing = 0.5 inches of increment
2. Mill -> Initialize
3. File Import -> auto detect file -> select the one with the correct dimension	
4. To move imported image: option 1: select all layers and drag to the position
						   option 2: select all layers, Edit -> offset (More precise)
5. Check all corners of the image to make sure that the foot of  the milling head will stay in the
   boundary of the board to prevent damage to the milling machine; 
   Right click on the corner -> machine -> jump to cursor
6. Layer Isolation and Rubout:
   Isolate = define the outline of each shape on the board precisely;
			 Use small bits to isolate to make sure rubout bits will not damage the outline
   Rubout = Remove large area of copper 
7. to cut the outline of board: use isolate with a 62 mill routing bit (Delete everything except the outline)
8. Repeat step 5
9. Mill -> Run Layer -> set the speed to move and RPM -> Jog
   Test the depth to mill into the copper layer before Isolate and Rubout
   Test the depth to cut the board before drill and cut
   Speed = 20 - 25 inch/min for 11 and 20 mill bit
		         5 inch/min for 125 mill bit to isolate
				10 inch/min for 125 mill bit to rubout
		   Bigger bit uses slower speed		   
   RPM = Use default RPM; bigger bit uses slower RPM
10. After finish the top layer: Select all layers; Edit -> Mirror
	Flip the board on the milling table according the mirrored image
11. For drill holes, if the correct size cannot be found, use contour router to	drill the board
